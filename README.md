TypeSchema
==========

An ECMAScript data schema system which based on data type validation.

- [API DOC](./docs)
- [中文文档](https://www.tangshuang.net/5625.html)

TypeSchema is a js runtime data schema system, which contains 4 parts: Rule, Type, Schema and Model.
You can use TypeSchema to:

- define your own data type
- validate data structure
- formulate data by type
- watch data change
- formulate data from backend to frontend

## Install

```
npm i typeschema
```

## Usage

```js
import Ts from 'typeschema'
```

or

```js
const { Ts } = require('typeschema')
```

or

```html
<script src="/node_modules/typeschema/dist/index.js"></script>
<script>
const { Ts } = window['typeschema']
</script>
```

## Concepts

Before we develop, we should learn about four concepts.

### Rule

A `Rule` is a Behavior Definition of an automic data.
For example, `var a = 10` and we know `a` is a number.
But how do you know `a` is a number which will be stored/computed as number type by V8? And how do you know a variable is a what behavior definition?

We have native prototypes/definition:

- String
- Number: should be a finite number, not match `NaN` `"123"` and `Infinity`
- Boolean: should be one of `true` or `false`
- Object: should be a normal object like `{}`, not match instance of class, array and Object self
- Array: should be a normal array like `[]`, not match instance of class inherited from Array and Array self
- Function
- RegExp: should be a string match regexp
- Symbol: should be a symbol
- NaN
- Infinity
- Date
- Promise

But these do not contains all of what we want, we want more.
Now you can use Rule to define a behavior definition of a variable.

And we extended so that we now have:

- Int
- Float
- Numeric: number or number string
- Null
- Undefined
- Any

And to use `Rule` conveniently, we provide functions to generate rules:

- asynchronous(async fn:type)
- validate(fn, msg)
- match(...types)
- ifexist(type)
- ifnotmatch(type, defaultValue)
- determine(fn:type)
- shouldexist(fn, type)
- shouldnotexist(fn)
- implement(Constructor)
- equal(value)
- lambda(inputType, outputType)

After you learn the usage of `Rule`, you can define your own rule to create new definition.

```js
// example
import { Rule } from 'typeschema'
export const NumberString = new Rule('NumberString', value => typeof value === 'string' && /^\-?[0-9]+(\.{0,1}[0-9]+){0,1}$/.test(value))
```

### Type

A `Type` is a data nature, quality or characteristic.
You call a data as some type data, it means you know what genera it belongs to.
For example, you call a boy as a Person, because you know the boy has what a Person should contains: a head, two hands and may talk.
In summary, Type contains the data behavior definition, the data structure and the ability to maintain data change as defined.
So a Type has the ability to check and trace data's characteristic, and throw out warn to user if the data is not of current Type.

To create a type, you can use:

- new Type(pattern)

And we have define some data structure:

- new Dict({ ... })
- new List([ ... ])
- new Tuple([ ... ])
- new Enum([ ... ])

```
+-------------+----------+----------+--
| TypeSchema  |    JS    |  Python  |
+=============+==========+==========+==
|    Dict     |  Object  |   dict   |
+-------------+----------+----------+-------------------
|    List     |  Array   |   list   |  mutable array
+-------------+----------+----------+--------------------
|    Enum     |   Set    |   set    |
+-------------+----------+----------+-------------------
|    Tuple    |          |   tuple  |  immutable determined array
+-------------+----------+----------+------------------------------
```

The output of these constructors are all types which can be used in our system.
And these 4 types are extended from `Type`.
Later I will tell you how to create type by using these constructors.

And to use `Type` conveniently, we provide functions to generate types:

- type(pattern)
- dict({ ... })
- list([ ... ])
- tuple([ ... ])
- enumerate([ ... ])

**Pattern**

To define a type, you should provide data behavior definition and data structure, these make up a Pattern.
A Pattern is what passed into `Type` constructors.

```js
const SomePattern = {
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  code: NumberString, // Rule
  books: BooksListType, // Type
}
const SomeType = new Dict(SomePattern)
```

Pattern is the design of type to implement the type's ability.
You can use js native prototypes/class/value or Rule or Type in a Pattern.
And different type constructor need different pattern form.

### Schema

A Schema is to describe data structure interaction logic.
In javascript, we use object to reflect data set which contains fields, so in TypeSchema you should use object to define Schema.

A schema do not care the real data, it create a abstract data structure to validate and formulate data.
By using formulated data, your business code will never have type or structure problem.

```
+-------------+        +------------+
|  api data   |   ->   |   schema   |  -> formulated data: non-type-problem data as schema discribed
+-------------+        +------------+
```

Here schema is like a constraint to prevent data error in business code.

```js
const PersonSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    default: '',
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
    default: 0,
  },
  sex: {
    type: Number,
    default: 'M',
  },
  code: {
    type: NumberString,
    default: '0',
  },
  history: HistorySchema, // Schema
  books: [BookSchema], // Schema list
})

fetch('xxx').then(res => res.json()).then(data => PersonSchema.ensure(data)).then(data => console.log(data))
// final data will have PersonSchema data structure whatever the backend data's structure is.
// you can use the final data without worry
```

### Model

A model is a data container which provide features about data operation.
We always use a model in our business code to use data.
Js native data is very weak, we provide a model that you can watch data change and based on schema, so that you can make your business logic more clear.

- watch data change
- computed property
- validate
- extract formdata

Model is used to create controllable data, it always used in bussiness code and we do not know how developers will use a model.
So it is designed to be simple and principle.
